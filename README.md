										PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
										
	This program is created to run two different types of Algorithms to test the Gizmolios Project to see
which algorithm of the two are the most effective and causes less penalty at the end of the day.

	Over the program itself generates random Customer, a random Gizmolio and it's price, 
along with the Order Arrival Time, and the Requested Time, and how far apart each Order get placed.
	 
	The two different type of Algorithm help generate a less penalty efficiency process of creating Gizmolios.

	And at the end of the program allows you to store the result in your computer for future reference.

	The Program itself is store in different packages for easier excess. For example all the Blueprint 
are under the Blueprint package

	It is a simple menu based program that asks the user how they would like to run the program
	
	** You do not require an Internet Connection to run this program. Unless you like continue with Database 
and GUI part of this program. We require you to get connected to an Internet. **
	
	
										INSTRUCTION FOR DATABASE

	** Before continuing further please make sure you have a Internet connection. Hence the Database part of this program
requires a Internet Connection. **
	
	MySQL is a well known open source database. This record will tell you the best way to download, unzip, 
and utilize an item named XAMPP. This isn't an introduce�only an unzip. XAMPP contains numerous incredible 
open source apparatuses including the Apache Web server, MySQL database, and phpMyAdmin to control the database 
item. Here is data on the adaptation that we will utilize. NOTE: You can utilize any form of the product � 
you don't have to utilize this one. This is a more established form however works fine and dandy and has negligible 
issues, so I propose that you utilize it except if you have xampp as of now introduced or have another motivation to 
change adaptations.

	Go to: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html. Select the file according your computer operating system and 
choose to save the file somewhere on your computer. The file will be about 200 MB. Unzip the file directly onto 
your c: drive. You can put it elsewhere and, in most cases, will not have a problem

After the download is complete. 
Step 1. Open XAMPP software on your computer.
Step 2. Once the XAMPP in launched. Select Start on the right hand side for Apache and MySQL
Step 3. Then Select Admin for MySQL from the right hand side corner. This will take you to your internet browser 
		to phpMyAdmin.
Step 4. On the Top bread-crumb trial. Select User Accounts.
Step 5. On the page scroll down and Select Add new user under the New Column.
Step 6. Create a Username and a Password this well be required later for importing the program result to MySQL database.
Step 7. Under Username for Host Name Select Local.
Step 8. Select All under the Database for user Account. And Select the Check All box under Global Privileges.
Step 9. Select Go on the bottom right corner. You will get a green check mark which means the account was successfully 
		created. If you do not get a check mark please try again. Or Web search for related example to help you.
Step 10. Click on (Server: 127.0.0.1) on the top left hand corner.
Step 11. Then Click on SQL tab.
Step 12. Copy and paste the code inside the bracket in the SQL box. [ CREATE DATABASE ______ ] replace the blank with a 
		 database name you want to create.
Step 13. Click GO on the bottom right corner. This will create your database.

											INSTRUTION ON HOW THE PROGRAM RUNS
											
	Option 1 being The first Algorithm to test for penalty efficiency is the Highest Penalty First (HPF) 
this algorithm run the program on the bases of creating the Gizmolios with higher penalty first and the 
lower penalty at the last

	Option 2 being the second Algorithm uses Smart Penalty Algorithm (SPA) to get as less penalty as possible
this algorithm run the program on the bases of just taking the penalty for the Gizmolios that are requested 
in lesser time than possible to create the Gizmolios. Instead it just takes that penalty charge and creates 
all the other Gizmolios to minimize the penalty.

	Option 3 will guide the user to store the final result for future reference.
	
	Option 4 Before you continue with option Please make sure you have gone thru Instruction for Database and 
complete Step 1-13. Otherwise you will have hard time connecting to Database exporting your results.This option 
will guide the user to get connected to the database by asking the user to input their Username and Password. 
Along with that they will ask the user for the database name. So it will import the result to that specific database. 
If you have not created a Database yet please follow Step 10-13 under Instruction for Database to create a database.

	Option 5 guide you thru importing the result to your database in phpMyAdmin. Where you can see all your end result for 
the program divide into separate table for future reference.

	Option 6 will close your connection to database for phpMyAdmin. After this you will no longer be able to export anything 
to Database.
	
	Option 7 ends the program.
	
	This Concludes the instruction on how to run this program and what to do before and while using this program. Thank you 
user for using our program and Hope you enjoy this Object Oriented Program (OOP) which runs on menu based programming. Please 
refer back to Readme.txt files if you are stuck between the program.
