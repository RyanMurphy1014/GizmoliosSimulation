# What is github
Github is a way to keep all team members in a project's files in sync. As well as keep track of changes and issues found by members. It has an easy integration into Eclipse or any other IDE being used. Github also includes a project section where a to-do list can be created, tasks can be assigned to individuals, and progress can be tracked. 

# How to integrate with eclipse
[This video] explains how to work with Github inside of eclipse. Since I already have a repository started all you have to do is select **File>Import>Git>Project From Git>Clone URI** and copy the clone link from the github page. After everyone has an account I will have to add you as a contributor to the project to give you permission to commit to the project

# Keywords
|Keyword | Meaning|
| ------ | ------|
|Repository|The main project folder|
|Commit|Save (You only have to commit when you do a significant cahnge that you want to publish, you can still do normal saving to the |computer)|
|Push|Upload (It is recomended you use the Commit and Push option)|
|Pull|Download (Do this everytime you start working on the project to have the most up to date version|
|Branch|A seperate copy of the main project that can be worked on without effecting or breaking the master version|
|Merge|To combine one branch into another|
|Fork|A copy of the repository for an outside user who is not a trusted contributor (This is used for people working on an open-source project)|
|Pull Request|A request from an outside user to the contributors of a project to pull their forked version and add it to the original repository (An example of this is somebody creating a feature in an open-source project and asking the creators to use his submissions)|

# Branch Layout
What I want to try is to use the Master Branch only for approved and final submission/checkpoint versions. Each team will have their own branch to work in for their portion. If any large features are created it might not be a bad idea to create a sub branch off of the team branch. After the feature is created it can be merged back into the team branch. 
[Here is a good video explaining this kind of workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJnFGMclhU8)

# Issues 
It is highly recomended that we peer review the majority of our commits for any logical errors, typos, Javadoc errors, and over complication. If you notice a problem you can open up an error form to alert the author of the commit of a problem.
